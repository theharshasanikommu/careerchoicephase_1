# ⚠️ SECURITY WARNING - ACTION REQUIRED

## 🚨 Your OpenAI API Key Was Exposed!

You accidentally added your real API key to `backend/.env.example` which may be tracked by Git.

### ✅ Immediate Actions Required:

**1. Revoke the exposed API key:**
- Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Find the key starting with `sk-proj-4PAoJqPx...`
- Click "Revoke" or delete it
- Create a NEW key

**2. Add the NEW key to the correct file:**

Edit `.env` in the **ROOT** directory (not backend/.env.example):

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-new-key-here
```

**3. Restart frontend:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 📝 Important Notes:

### ✅ Correct Location:
- **`.env`** in root folder (already in .gitignore)
- This file is NOT tracked by Git

### ❌ Wrong Location:
- **`.env.example`** (this IS tracked by Git)
- Never put real keys here

### 🔒 Security Best Practices:

1. **Never commit API keys to Git**
2. **Always use .env files** (they're in .gitignore)
3. **Revoke exposed keys immediately**
4. **Use different keys for dev/production**

## 🎯 Quick Fix:

```bash
# 1. Create/edit .env in root folder
echo "VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api" > .env
echo "VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-new-key-here" >> .env

# 2. Restart frontend
npm run dev
```
